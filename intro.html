           <h1> ABOUT ME</h1>
           <p>Hi, I'm Kaushiki Bhattacharyya, and I'm an aspiring web developer with a deep love for programming. I'm well-versed in languages like C++ and Java, and I'm eager to explore the exciting realms of Machine Learning and Python. </p>

            <p>I come from the charming city of Kolkata, where my fascination with technology began during my early years at St. Stephens School. Reading books and immersing myself in fictional movies opened up my mind to endless possibilities, fueling my desire to create my own digital wonders.
            
            Currently, I'm pursuing my studies in Electronics and Communication Engineering at the prestigious National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur. My academic journey has honed my engineering skills and equipped me with problem-solving abilities that I apply to my coding endeavors. </p>

            
            <p>Programming is my passion, and I take great pride in crafting elegant and efficient code. C++ and Java are my forte, empowering me to take on challenging projects with confidence. However, I'm well aware that the tech industry is ever-evolving, and I'm committed to staying at the forefront of innovation.
            
            The realms of Machine Learning and Python have captivated my interest, and I'm excited to dive headfirst into these domains. The potential of Artificial Intelligence to reshape industries motivates me, and I envision myself contributing to groundbreaking advancements that can shape the future.
            
            When I'm not immersed in the digital world, I find joy in engaging in physical activities. Chess and badminton are my favorite pastimes, as they not only challenge me but also instill valuable lessons in sportsmanship and determination.
            
            During my leisure time, I love to explore the world around me. Traveling allows me to appreciate the beauty and diversity of our planet, and it inspires me to think creatively and innovatively. </p>
            
            <p>Being a people person, I cherish building connections and collaborating with others. I firmly believe in the power of teamwork and recognize that the collective effort of a diverse group can lead to extraordinary results.
            
            With an unyielding passion for web development, an insatiable thirst for knowledge, boundless curiosity, and a love for exploration, I'm on a mission to make a mark in the tech world. With every line of code I write, I move one step closer to realizing my dreams and making a meaningful impact on the ever-changing landscape of technology. </p>
